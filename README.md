# Database-Project
CIS 3212 Project
## Team Name: Coding Turtles
## Team Members: Ruth and Raina
## Outline For Project:
## Project Introduction: Due to coronavirus restraunts have started online ordering and delivery services are much more common and normalized these days. A college campus has pushed its local restraunts and school cafeterias to start up delivry services for the students. Schools are now debating on whether or not to take control of the delivery to ensure that students and staff are the only ones delivering food on campus for safety and health reasons. We will be understanding a test database for a campus controlled food delivery service similar to craveoncampus.com. We will be enhancing with a rating system for both restraunts and delivery drivers.
